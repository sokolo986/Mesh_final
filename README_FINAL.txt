Our project requires the loading of several packages in order to run.  For one, please follow the instructions for downloading MLPack via the Mlpack website.
http://www.mlpack.org/doxygen.php?doc=build.html

Next, use our Makefile to compile your files.  Ensure that any folder specific requirements are modified accordingly in the Makefile, such as the INCLUDES Mlpack directory and the LDFLAGS path.

Finally, compile the project with "make ./[name of file]" and then run it using a matching data/[node] and data[tri] example. We specifically used the pond4 example, so it is best to use that one when examining our code.
